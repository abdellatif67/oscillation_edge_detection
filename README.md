Code to extract edge from video clip of an oscillating camera
The method requires camera to perform circular periodic oscillation modulated on its own motion.
Two code snippet are provided, the synth.py for processing of synthetic generated files and an example is shown in Case_c04_10_NG.avi, which shows synthetic oscillations with added 10 % variance Gaussian noise.
The code for processing real images is the real_02.py, and the video clip is given in file r_17.mp4
